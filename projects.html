        <h3>A Plan for Action for Social Media Response</h3><br>
        <h4>/ About</h4>
        <p>Welcome! I'm Casey Salvador, undergraduate of the College of Charleston. This portion is dedicated to provide information about the Wells Fargo Analytics competition for DATA 101. Enjoy and feel free to navigate the following sections, which provides information on the project. Please feel free as well to contact me via my contacts page located.</p>
        <h4>/ Challenge</h4>
        <p>Dialogues on social media can provide tremendous insight into the behaviors, desires, pains, and thoughts of consumers. We'd like your help in developing a repeatable process that identifies, classifies, and extracts the underlying drivers of consumer financial conversations and comments in social media data.
<br>
Provide an analytic report of 1,500 words or less that is structured as outlined below, utilizing the dataset.txt provided by Wells Fargo.</p>
        <h4> 1 Preparing the Data</h4>
        <p>In order to pull useful information from the data given, we but the dataset in R studio. We mined the tweets and posts through R Studio, getting rid of blank spaces, messages that did not tag a particular bank.  Additionally, we spell checked the information.</p>
        <h4> 2 Approach and Methodology</h4>
        <p>
        <i>Deliverable A - Describe your Approach and Methodology. Include a visual representation of your analytic process flow.</i>
        <br>
        Once we prepared the tweets and posts for analysis, we used an agile methodology so we could test 
        <br>
        small amounts of data at a time to quicken the process, that would be representative of things we could 
        <br>
        get when testing the entire data set.  
        <br>
        An agile methodology was chosen so the many questions could be answered and so methods could be repeated and compared for each bank. Through a process, we tested 1000 random samples of the entire data set and then 1000 random samples of only bank A to compare and contrast differences.
        <br>
        Below, find a graphical representation of the analytic and developmental approach taken.  It will show first cleaning the data where the team got rid of any additional room that was taking up space. The team then tested the data overall to find positive and negative sentiment words as well as high frequency words.  This gave us the framework to look at the data as a whole before looking into the context of each bank.  This step also allowed for the creation of two separate files for negative and positive posts.  
        <br>
        The team indexed each bank to then replicate the tests: positive and negative as well as word 
        <br>
        frequency. 
        <br>
        The results were then tested against the results as a whole.
